        "* Learn how to run a rule-based sentiment analysis module (VADER)\n",
        "* Learn how to run a machine learning sentiment analysis module (Scikit-Learn/ Naive Bayes)\n",
        "* Learn how to run scikit-learn metrics for the quantitative evaluation\n",
        "* Learn how to perform and interpret a quantitative evaluation of the outcomes of the tools (in terms of Precision, Recall, and F<sub>1</sub>)\n",
        "* Learn how to evaluate the results qualitatively (by examining the data)\n",
        "* Get insight into differences between the two applied methods\n",
        "* Get insight into the effects of using linguistic preprocessing\n",
        "* Be able to describe differences between the two methods in terms of their results\n",
        "* Get insight into issues when applying these methods across different  domains\n",

        "* a quantitative evaluation concerns the scores (Precision, Recall, and F<sub>1</sub>) provided by scikit's classification_report. It includes the scores per category, as well as micro and macro averages. Discuss whether the scores are balanced or not between the different categories (positive, negative, neutral) and between precision and recall. Discuss the shortcomings (if any) of the classifier based on these scores\n",
        "* an error analysis regarding the misclassifications of the classifier. It involves going through the texts and trying to understand what has gone wrong. It servers to get insight in what could be done to improve the performance of the classifier. Do you observe patterns in misclassifications?  Discuss why these errors are made and propose ways to solve them."

        "1. We find that the first sentence is valid. The sentence \"I love apples\" is a possitive sentence and thus the compound score should reflect the positivity exhibited in the sentence. In this case, since the compound score is 0.6369 (which is a high positive score), we can conclude that the sentence is positive.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. The sentence \"I don't love apples\" is the opposite of the first sentence and thus it is a negative sentence. In this case we expect VEDAR to poduce a high negative score for the sentence, which is reflected in the -0.5216 (high negative score) score.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. \"I love apples :-)\" is a similar sentence to the first one. While it is arguable wheather in this sentence the extra smily face really increases the positivity of the sentence, we at least expect the score to be as positive if not more positive then the first sentence since the same wording is used. We see that the score for this sentence is 0.7579, which is higher then the 1st sentence observed score of 0.6369.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. \"These houses are in ruins\" is a sentence carrying a negative sentiment. From these sentences we expect a high negative score, which should distinguish it from the neutral score and with a VADER score of -0.4404, we find that the sentence is indead classified as a negative sentence with a high negative compound score.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. \"These houses are certainly not considered ruins\". We would consider this sentence to be a neutral sentence. If we compare it to the first sentence: \"I love apples\" we see that the score difference between the 2 is only about 0.0502, but we can clearly tell that the first sentence is much more positive than the second one. From the VADAR output, we can see that the sentence receives a more neutral score than positive one, but because the compound score is a \"weighted\" score, the words, which are considered positive, have much more \"weight\" and thus VADER gives this sentence a much more positive score than we would agree with. We believe that this should be much closer to neutral (still a positive score, just not as positive) than VADER curretly classifies it as.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. \"He lies in the chair in the garder\". This sentence is classified as a negative sentence, when the sentence should have been classified as a neutral one. VADER classified the sentence as negative because it did not distinguish between the two different versions of \"lies\": \"lies to a person\", meaning that you tell a false statement to another person that you might or might not know is not true, whilst \"lies on a bed\", meaning to sit/rest on top of a bed. In this case VEDAR only considered the \"lies\" word to refer to the act of providing false information, thus the sentence was classified as a negative sentence, when in fact it should have been classified as a neutral sentence.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. \"This house is like any other house.\" The following sentence was classified as a positive sentence with the score of 0.3612, when it should have been classified as a neutral sentence. As could be seen with sentence 5, VADER gave a much bigger nuetral score to the sentence that a positive one, but because of how the compound score is \"weighted\", the compound score produced a much more positive result than expected. This is due to relitively high \"weight\" of the word \"like\" which in this context means \"similar to\", while VEDAR considered the words meaning to be \"enjoy/prefer\". Thus the score became much more positive.\n",
        "\n",
        "From these examples, we can see that VADER does not take into account the surrounding context around a word to judge if a words has a positive meaning or a negative one."
